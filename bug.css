The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if the values it operates on are not explicitly defined as numbers (using `px`, `em`, `rem`, etc.).  For example, using `calc(100% - 50)` will likely fail because `50` is not specified as pixels, ems, or any other valid CSS unit.  Similarly, using variables that aren't explicitly defined with units can cause problems.  Another example is using `calc()` within a nested calculation without clear unit definitions.
